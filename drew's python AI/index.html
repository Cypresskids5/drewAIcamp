    <h2>Day 3 summary</h2>
    <p>During the third day we coded an AI that takes our input of text and turns it into an image. We also made a slide show about a future business that could be made and we decorated it with AI generated pictures. Finally we used huggingface.co to get our stablility AI and make a collage using our own AI generated images. </p>
